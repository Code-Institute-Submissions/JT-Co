In this project, the aim was to build a static front-end site that presented useful information to the users whilst using all the technologies I have learned. I feel I have accomplished this and more when I had also incorporated something that wasnâ€™t taught and successfully found out how to do it myself through.
When I started the course to become a fullstack web developer, I had spoken to a friend of mine about building a website for his company. As soon as this first milestone project was set, I was able to consistently converse with JT & Co to gather helpful resources, imagery and text I could incorporate to the site, with the intention of making it as genuine as possible.
JT & Co is a thriving property development and maintenance company based in London. With his permission, I was able to take all the information he had provided to design a modern website to match his contemporary business. He and I had similar ideas where the customer could access the site and have no difficulties seeing what work he produces and how to get in touch with a click of a button.
